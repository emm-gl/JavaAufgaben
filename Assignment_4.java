HW Assignment #4 Java Fundamentals by Pirple

//Instructions
1. Return to your 2nd homework assignments, when you described your favorite song.
2. Refactor that code so all the variables are held as in a single data structure as keys and values.
3. Refactor your print statements so that you have a single loop that passes through each item in the data structure and prints out it's key and then it's value.
